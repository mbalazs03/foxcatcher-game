# Fox Catcher Board Game

The game is played on a chessboard with 4 dark pawns (hounds) and 1 light pawn (fox). One player controls the hounds, and the other controls the fox. Players take turns to move:

- The hounds can move diagonally forward by one square.
- The fox can move diagonally by one square in any direction, forward or backward.

The player controlling the fox wins if they maneuver the fox behind the hounds. The player controlling the hounds wins if they trap the fox in a position where it cannot move.
